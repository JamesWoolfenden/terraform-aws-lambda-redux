# Short description of this project
description: |-
  The terraform module creates a lex lambda combination. To use a lambda with an intent a number of other objects are either required. In this module I have included a number of reasonable default values and policies.
  This should make it easier to build the lambdas that go with your lex objects.
  The lamda permission is a array/list this means you can add as many permissions to lambda as you need to.
  The create of roles and or/ policy is configurable with switches.

  How to use this project
usage: |-
  ```hcl
  module "lexlambda" {
  source = "github.com/jameswoolfenden/terraform-aws-lex-lambda"

  lambdapermmissions = [{
    intent  = "Pizza"
    sourcearn    = "arn:aws:lex:${data.aws_region.current.name}:${data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id}:intent:Pizza:*"
  }]

  description      = "${var.description}"
  name             = "${var.name}"
  filename         = "${path.cwd}/lambda.zip"
  policyname       = "${var.name}"
  region_name      = "${data.aws_region.current.name}"
  role_name        = "${var.name}"
  account_id       = "${data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id}"
  common_tags      = "${var.common_tags}"
  }
  ```
